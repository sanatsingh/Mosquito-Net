# Mosquito-Net
A deep learning based lightweight Computer Aided Diagnostic System with an aim of easing the weary task of detection of Malaria infected cells by examination of blood smears under microscope and to enable the practical use of the model in remote and rural areas where high computation power and network may or may not be available.

Public Repository in spirit of upcoming *World Malaria Day* - 25th April.

Two models have been provided with different activation fuctions (ReLU and Mish) & fc layers.

## About Malaria
Malaria is a mosquito-borne life-threatening disease caused by five species of Plasmodium parasites (single-celled organisms). 

## Note
As COVID-19 spreads rapidly around the globe, there is an urgent need to aggressively tackle the novel coronavirus while ensuring that other killer diseases, such as malaria, are not neglected. WHO urges countries to ensure the continuity of malaria services in the context of the pandemic, provided that best practices to protect health workers and communities are followed.
