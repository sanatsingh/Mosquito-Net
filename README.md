### Note
As COVID-19 spreads rapidly around the globe, there is an urgent need to aggressively tackle the novel coronavirus while ensuring that other killer diseases, such as malaria, are not neglected. WHO urges countries to ensure the continuity of malaria services in the context of the pandemic, provided that best practices to protect health workers and communities are followed.
